Using Sesame with the GUI
==========================================

The Sesame GUI can be launched from the command line by navigating to the base sesame directory and executing::

   python app.py

Alternatively, the GUI can be installed as a standalone executable (currently available only for Windows).

The Sesame GUI has three main tabs - system, simulation, and analysis.  The File menu enables users to save and load GUI simulation files.  The View menu provides options for viewing the spatial distribution of defects and certain system properties (like mobility and lifetime).  The ``Console`` menu provides the option of an interactive python console below the main window.  

In the following subsections we detail the content and use of each of the window tabs.
